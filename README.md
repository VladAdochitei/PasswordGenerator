# PasswordGenerator
This Python script generates random passwords that are exported into a .txt file (output file named: passwords.txt)
 - The passwords are customizable, meaning that the user can select how many passwords he wants to generate while also having control over the length of the passwords.
 - Every batch of passwords is separated by a empty row.
